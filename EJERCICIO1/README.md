Known Issues
----------
- The GDNative version does not allow for default arguments in functions, thus some functions may have odd behaviors.  If you are using this version of GodotSteam you are required to pass any argument that has a default in the module version. Also, there are no enums in the GDNative version due to how it is structured.
- The function `setRichPresence` when used on Windows will occasionally send the key as the value. This behavior does not happen on Linux nor OSX; it also doesn't exist in any versions of the module nor GDExtension.  In which case, please check your rich presence is set correctly by reading the rich presence back when using Windows and GDNative.

Quick How-To
----------

- Visit the Godot Asset Library either through the website or in the editor and search for GodotSteam.
